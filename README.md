## LyrifyBot

We wrote a chatbot that is capable of recognizing music authors in natural language and returning sentences based on the lyrics from these artists. Essentially, this way the bot can reply using the style of the lyrics of certain artists, capsulating a lot of their speech pattern and vocabulary. 

The goal of the bot was to be able to return answers based on the vocabulary of the artists as well as make contextual sense. However, this may have been a little overzealous for this homework assignment and we downscaled it a little bit to what it is now; a bot that returns sentences based on the lyrics of artists. The bot is also capable of a little bit of chitchat, and all in all usable. 

The bot can be used by mentioning an artist in your message. If one is mentioned, the bot also looks whether a number is mentioned. The response then will be a sentence based on the lyrics of the artist with, if given, a maximum number of characters of the number specified in your message.
